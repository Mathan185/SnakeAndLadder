# 🎲 Snake and Ladder Game (Console-Based Java App)

This is a simple **console-based Snake and Ladder game** implemented in Java. It simulates the classic board game where two players roll a dice, move across a numbered board (typically 1 to 100), and encounter:

- 🐍 **Snakes** – which pull the player down
- 🪜 **Ladders** – which push the player up
